## **1. Introduction**

The purpose of this document is to outline the functional and non-functional requirements for an irrigation system that uses Raspberry Pi modules to manage irrigation zones. Each module consists of a Raspberry Pi, various sensors, and the ability to register itself with a cloud-based backend system during initialization. This system aims to provide automatic, efficient, and scalable irrigation management for agricultural and landscaping applications.
