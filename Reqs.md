# **Irrigation System Using Raspberry Pi and Cloud Integration - Requirements Document**

## **1. Introduction**

The purpose of this document is to outline the functional and non-functional requirements for an irrigation system that uses Raspberry Pi modules to manage irrigation zones. Each module consists of a Raspberry Pi, various sensors, and the ability to register itself with a cloud-based backend system during initialization. This system aims to provide automatic, efficient, and scalable irrigation management for agricultural and landscaping applications.

## **2. Scope**

The system consists of multiple Raspberry Pi modules distributed across irrigation zones. Each module is equipped with sensors for soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and other environmental parameters. The Raspberry Pi automatically registers to a cloud-based backend system for real-time monitoring, data storage, and control management.

### **Key Features**

- **Automatic Registration to Cloud**: Each module automatically registers with the cloud system upon startup.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Sensors report environmental data to the cloud for real-time monitoring and analysis.
- **Irrigation Control**: Modules can control irrigation systems based on predefined rules and data from sensors.
- **Mobile/Web Interface**: User access via a mobile app or web dashboard for controlling and monitoring irrigation zones.
- **Scalability**: The system should allow easy addition of new Raspberry Pi modules (irrigation zones).

## **3. System Requirements**

### **3.1 Functional Requirements**

### **Irrigation Zone Control**

- **FR1**: The system should support multiple irrigation zones, each controlled by a Raspberry Pi module.
- **FR2**: Each module will have control over water valves for its corresponding zone.
- **FR3**: Irrigation zones should be managed based on soil moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors.
- **FR4**: The system should allow users to configure irrigation schedules and rules through a mobile/web interface.

### **Sensor Integration**

- **FR5**: Each module will include sensors for:
    - Soil moisture
    - Temperature
    - Humidity
    - Rainfall (optional)
    - Light intensity (optional)
- **FR6**: Sensor data should be collected at configurable intervals and transmitted to the cloud backend.
- **FR7**: The system should automatically trigger irrigation actions based on real-time sensor data (e.g., if soil moisture is below a threshold, the irrigation system should activate).

### **Cloud Integration**

- **FR8**: Each Raspberry Pi module should register itself automatically to a cloud-based backend (BE) when powered on.
- **FR9**: Upon registration, the system should send the moduleâ€™s configuration, including sensor types and irrigation zone data, to the backend.
- **FR10**: The cloud should store historical data from sensors (e.g., soil moisture levels over time) for future analysis and decision-making.
- **FR11**: The cloud system should send control commands to Raspberry Pi modules for irrigation management (e.g., start or stop irrigation).

### **User Interface (Mobile/Web)**

- **FR12**: The system should provide a web and mobile interface for users to monitor and control irrigation zones.
- **FR13**: The interface should show real-time data from sensors (e.g., soil moisture levels, temperature).
- **FR14**: Users should be able to configure irrigation schedules and control zones manually or automatically.
- **FR15**: The interface should allow users to set thresholds for automatic irrigation (e.g., start irrigation if soil moisture < 30%).

### **Notification and Alerts**

- **FR16**: The system should send notifications to users for significant events such as:
    - Low soil moisture triggering irrigation
    - Irrigation failure or issues with sensors
    - Rain detection to prevent irrigation
- **FR17**: Notifications should be sent via email, SMS, or app push notifications.

### **3.2 Non-Functional Requirements**

### **Scalability**

- **NFR1**: The system should support an arbitrary number of Raspberry Pi modules (i.e., irrigation zones) without significant performance degradation.
- **NFR2**: New Raspberry Pi modules should be able to register automatically and join the system seamlessly.

### **Reliability**

- **NFR3**: The cloud-based backend should ensure high availability with redundancy mechanisms.
- **NFR4**: The system should have failover mechanisms in case of Raspberry Pi module or cloud failure.

### **Security**

- **NFR5**: Data transmitted between Raspberry Pi modules and the cloud should be encrypted (e.g., using HTTPS or MQTT with TLS).
- **NFR6**: The cloud backend should have access control to ensure that only authorized users can configure and manage irrigation zones.

### **Performance**

- **NFR7**: Sensor data should be transmitted to the cloud backend with minimal latency (preferably within seconds).
- **NFR8**: Commands sent from the cloud backend to Raspberry Pi modules (e.g., to control irrigation valves) should be executed within a reasonable time (e.g., less than 5 seconds).

### **Power Management**

- **NFR9**: The system should be energy-efficient, particularly for Raspberry Pi modules operating in outdoor environments.
- **NFR10**: Power outages should not affect the ability to resume irrigation operations once power is restored.

### **Data Integrity and Backup**

- **NFR11**: The system should have mechanisms for data backup to prevent loss of sensor data and configuration settings.

### **System Maintenance**

- **NFR12**: The system should allow over-the-air (OTA) updates for both Raspberry Pi modules and the cloud backend.

## **4. Cloud Backend Requirements**

### **4.1 Functional Requirements**

- **FR18**: The backend system should support registration of new Raspberry Pi modules automatically via a secure API.
- **FR19**: The backend should store data from each Raspberry Pi module (e.g., sensor readings, irrigation logs).
- **FR20**: The backend should provide API endpoints for the mobile/web interface to fetch real-time data and send irrigation commands.

### **4.2 Non-Functional Requirements**

- **NFR13**: The backend should be scalable to handle a growing number of modules and users.
- **NFR14**: The backend should use a secure cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) with automated backups and data redundancy.

## **5. Hardware Requirements**

- **HR1**: Raspberry Pi (recommended models: Raspberry Pi 4 or Raspberry Pi Zero W) with GPIO ports for sensor connections and relay control.
- **HR2**: Soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and other optional environmental sensors.
- **HR3**: Water valves controlled by Raspberry Pi for irrigation management.
- **HR4**: Power supply suitable for outdoor environments, including potential solar panel integration.
- **HR5**: Optional rain sensor to prevent unnecessary irrigation during rain.

## **6. Assumptions and Constraints**

- The Raspberry Pi modules will be located outdoors, so they need to be housed in waterproof enclosures.
- The cloud backend will be based on a commercially available cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure).
- Internet connectivity will be required for modules to communicate with the cloud backend. In cases where connectivity is lost, the system should operate autonomously until reconnected.
